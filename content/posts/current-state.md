There is a first published version of SilverStrike on [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/silverstrike/). 

I have been using SilverStrike myself for about 6 months now, always adding stuff that I need.

I'm pretty happy with the core models and don't think they will get any big rework soon meaning that I consider the base parts pretty stable. You should consider the [rest API]({{< relref "rest-api.md" >}}) and import functionality rather experimental though.

At this point I welcome you to try out the demo, maybe try to install it yourself and import transactions from your exisiting system. I would be very happy with the feedback you have for me, telling me what is good and what needs to improved.

After getting some reviews I will feel more easy with recommending to use it "for real".
