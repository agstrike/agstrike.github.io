Here you can find features that will be implemented someday in no particular order


* Reports
* Piggy-banks
* Search support
* Mobile App


Things that will probably not come:
* Multi user support. As in different users accessing different data. Currently all users share all data. Since the primary target is self hosting, adding that feature is not a top priority
