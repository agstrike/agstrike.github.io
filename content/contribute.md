## Sending money

I don't have many costs connected to the development of SilverStrike and since I'm primarily developing for me,
I don't really need to be paid.
If you want to send me money (I don't want to use donation, because it will be a personal payment and not a donation),
you can do so using my [paypal.me link](https://paypal.me/simhnna).

The money will be used to:

* Keep the server used for this website and the demo running
* Buy a nicer domain (the current one is a free one...)
* Buy the occasional pizza and beer to keep me motivated to continue development
